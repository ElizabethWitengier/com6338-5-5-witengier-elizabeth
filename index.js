/*

Create an app that allows the user to change the color and font
size of the H1 element at the top of the page.

First, complete the HTML:
Add a text input field to the form to capture a font color change.
Add a number input field to the form to capture a font size change.

To each input, add:
- a name attribute that describes the data being captured.
- an id attribute that describes the input.
- a placeholder attribute.
- a label element with a for attribute that is the
same as the id attribute of its input.

To the number input, add:
- a step attribute that allows the field to increment in multiples of 8
- a min attribute set to 0

When submitting the form, the values from the inputs should be
used to change the CSS color and font-size of the H1 element.
Submitting the form should also clear each input field.
